# OPTION 1: PYTHON MOVIE GUESSING GAME
<b>Your assignment is to create a movie guessing game using python.</b>

### Directions and Requirements:
1. Your program should give your user five attempts to guess the correct answer. 
2. Each turn your guessing game should print out a clue as to what the movie answer is. 
3. If the user guesses incorrectly, the program will output a message telling them they are incorrect, the number of attempts they have left, and then the next clue. 
4. If the user exhausts all of their attempts, the program will inform them that the game is over and reveal what the correct movie answer is. 
5. If the user guesses the movie correctly, the program will congratulate the user for guessing the movie correctly. 

### Helpful hints:
- You will need to use a Python loop,
- You will need to use the input function to take in data.
- You will need to use Python conditional statements. 

<b><i>BONUS: Develop logic in your program to allow the user to guess another movie.</i></b> 


# OPTION 2: ROCK,PAPER, SCISSORS- BEST OF FIVE

<b>Your assignment is to develop a rock, paper, scissors game where the user must win three(3) rounds out of five (5) to win the game.</b>

### Directions and Requirements:
1. Your program should prompt the user to enter a number value that will represent rock, paper, and scissors. Your program must inform the user of what each number represents
2. When the user enters a value, the computer must randomly select another value, and then compare the values based on the rock, paper, scissors format (paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper). Once it generates and and compare the values it will output the result, telling the user if they won the round or not. It will then prompt them to enter their next move. 
3. Your game must loop for five (5) rounds. If the computer wins 3 rounds, the user loses, if the user wins 3 wins, the user wins. 

<b><i>BONUS: Develop logic for sitations where the game ends in a tie.</i></b> 

### Helpful hints: Your program will need to use the following:
- You will need to use a Python loop,
- You will need to use the input function to take in data.
- You will need to use Python conditional statements.
- You will need to use the random() function in Python.  

# Grading criteria and Requirements
- You need to create a folder called yourName_extra credit
- You need to name your python file 1 of 3 things:
extraCredit_rockPaperScissors.py
extraCredit_movieGussingGame.py 
extraCredit_DoubleProgram.py (if you decide to do both programs.)

- Your program must be wrapped inside of a function.
- You must follow the required naming conventions for your folder and python file.
- You will be graded on whether you used the proper Python formatting and syntax.
- You will be graded on the clarity and readability of your code. 
- You will be graded on how efficient your code runs. 
- You will be graded on your program being able to complete the tasks.
