# OPTION 1: PYTHON MOVIE GUESSING GAME
<b>Your assignment is to create a movie guessing game using python. Users will be given clues as to what the movie is.</b>

# Directions/ Requirements:
1. Your program should give your user five attempts to guess the correct answer. 
2. Each turn your guessing game should print out a clue as to what the movie answer is. 
3. If the user guesses incorrectly, the program will output a message telling them they are incorrect, the number of attempts they have left, and then the next clue. 
4. If the user exhausts all of their attempts, the program will inform them the game is over and reveal what the correct movie is. 
5. If the user guesses the movie correctly, the program will congratulate the user for guessing the movie correctly. 

# Helpful hints: your program will need to use the following:
- You will need to use a Python loop,
- You will need to use the input function to take in data.
- You will need to use Python conditional statements.

<b>Your assignment is to develop a rock, paper, scicors game, where the first user must win three(3) rounds out of five (5) wins.<b>

# Directions/ Requirements:
1. Your program should prompt the user to enter a number value that will represent rock, paper, and scissors. Your program must inform the user of what each number represents
2. When the user enters a value, the computer must randomly select another value, and then compare the values based on the rock, paper, scissors format (paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper)
3. Your game must loop for five (5) rounds. If the computer wins 3 rounds, the user loses, if the user wins 3 wins, the user wins. 

<b><i>BONUS: develop logic for sitations where the game ends in a tie.</i></b> 

# Helpful hints: your program will need to use the following:
- You will need to use a Python loop,
- You will need to use the input function to take in data.
- You will need to use Python conditional statements.
- You will need to use the random() function in Python.
