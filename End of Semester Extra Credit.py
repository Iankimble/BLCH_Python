# PYTHON MOVIE GUESSING GAME

# Your assignment is to create a movie guessing game using python. Users will be given clues as to what the movie is. 

# Directions/ Requirements:
# 1. Your program should give your user five attempts to guess the correct answer. 
# 2. Each turn your guessing game should print out a clue as to what the movie answer is. 
# 3. If the user guesses incorrectly, the program will output a message telling them they are incorrect, 
# the number of attempts they have left, and then the next clue. 
# 4. If the user exhausts all of their attempts, the program will inform them the game is over and reveal what the correct movie is. 
# 5. If the user guesses the movie correctly, the program will congratulate the user for guessing the movie correctly. 

# Helpful hints: your program will need to use the following:
# - you will need to use a Python loop,
# - you will need to use the input function to take in data.
# - you will need to use Python conditional statements. 

# Remember to take your time and break down the prompt into smaller pieces.
