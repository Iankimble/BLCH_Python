# Program Design Activity
Monday Async work November 20,2023. 

## INSTRUCTIONS
Complete your custom program prompt and or wireframes. If you did not complete either assignment, use today to do so.

For your project prompt, please answer the questions in complete sentences. Write your prompts
as if the person reading it does not know anything about software development

For your wireframes, it should be a clear visual guide on how your program will look and run.
For example, since we are working in the terminal, your wireframe should show what will be the 
first screen the user sees, followed by the next screen based on what the user does or does not input and so on. 

If you have completed both assignments, you may begin the coding portion of your program.
