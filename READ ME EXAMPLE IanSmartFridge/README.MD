# Ian's Smart Fridge

# About 
Ian's Smart Fridge is a program developed with Python that allows user's to do simple fridge operations by entering a variety of inputs from their computer. The goal of this app is to provide
users with more control over thier refriderator. In the near future, I plan to add more features to this program to allow users even more control over their refridgerator and other appliances.

# Features
Ian's Smart Fridge has three (3) main features:
1. Allows users to change the temperature of their refridgerator.
2. Allows users to check the contents of the refridgerator.
3. Allows users to select between getting ice and water from the machine.

This program was developed by Ian Kimble from Black Tech Philly.
