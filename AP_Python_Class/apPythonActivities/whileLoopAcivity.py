#1. In your own words, describe what a while loop is and provide an example of a
# while loop that you encounter in the real world, that was not said in class. 


#.2 Create a simple while loop that will iterate from 0 up until it gets to 20. 


#.3 Using the while loop from the previous example, add additional code that will
# pull every multiple of 5 from the loop and ADD it to a new list variable called
# multiples of 5. 
# Hint: you will need to use the modulus symbol.  


# 4. Create a function that will prompt a user to enter their password. If the user gets
# the password wrong 4 times, your function should return a message saying they are locked
# out. If they enter the password correctly, the should recieve a message telling them 
# that they are logged in. You can choose what the password will be.
