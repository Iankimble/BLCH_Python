# When ready, answer the following prompts

# 1.Create a simple list variable that contains 5 list items. It is up to you what will be in your list. 
# Some examples: favorite_atheletes, favorite_games, favorite_books, etc.  

# 2. Find and print the specific item in each list based on their index in the list
# HINT you will need to use a python built-in function that specifically lets you find items in a Python list. 

# find and print index 3
zoo_animals = ['wolf','giraffe','hippo','eagle','parrot']

# find and print index 1
sports_on_tv =['hockey','football','baseball','soccer','racing']

# find and print index 0
random_numbers = [10,100,12123, 1394, 1]

# 3. You have been hired by amazon to be an engineer. Your first assignment is to fix their
# shopping cart function. Your goal is to create a line of code that will
# allow users to enter the item they want as a string value, and add it to the items that
# are already exist in the cart. Once the new item is entered, a list of all items in the cart should print out. 

# HINT - for this function you will need to use the append() function. 

shopping_cart = ['notebook', 'pens','tape','mousepad']


# 4. Create a program that will only print out the odd numbers in this list. 

# HINT- to solve this you will need to use the range() function. 

number_list= [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
